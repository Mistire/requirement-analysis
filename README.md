# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository focuses on the Requirement Analysis phase in Software Development. It provides a structured approach to documenting, analyzing, and modeling system requirements for a booking management system. The goal is to create clear, comprehensive, and industry-standard documentation to guide development and ensure alignment with business objectives.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. 
It ensures that the development team understands **what the system must do** and **how it should behave** before any design or coding begins.

In the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), Requirement Analysis is crucial because it:

- **Defines clear project objectives:** Helps ensure that developers and stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the system should accomplish.
- **Reduces risks and errors:** Early identification of requirements prevents costly changes and misunderstandings later in the development process.
- **Supports system design and planning:** Provides a foundation for system architecture, database design, user interface design, and test planning.
- **Improves communication:** Acts as a formal record that aligns the development team, clients, and end-users on expectations.

Overall, Requirement Analysis acts as a blueprint for successful software development, bridging the gap between business needs and technical implementation.
