# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository focuses on the Requirement Analysis phase in Software Development. It provides a structured approach to documenting, analyzing, and modeling system requirements for a booking management system. The goal is to create clear, comprehensive, and industry-standard documentation to guide development and ensure alignment with business objectives.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. 
It ensures that the development team understands **what the system must do** and **how it should behave** before any design or coding begins.

In the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), Requirement Analysis is crucial because it:

- **Defines clear project objectives:** Helps ensure that developers and stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the system should accomplish.
- **Reduces risks and errors:** Early identification of requirements prevents costly changes and misunderstandings later in the development process.
- **Supports system design and planning:** Provides a foundation for system architecture, database design, user interface design, and test planning.
- **Improves communication:** Acts as a formal record that aligns the development team, clients, and end-users on expectations.

Overall, Requirement Analysis acts as a blueprint for successful software development, bridging the gap between business needs and technical implementation.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the SDLC because it ensures that software development is aligned with business goals and user needs. Key reasons include:

1. **Clarity in Project Scope:**  
   Clearly defines what the system should and should not do, preventing scope creep and misunderstandings between stakeholders and developers.

2. **Cost and Time Efficiency:**  
   Early identification of requirements and potential issues reduces costly revisions and delays later in development.

3. **Enhanced Communication:**  
   Provides a shared understanding of system objectives among developers, clients, and stakeholders, improving collaboration and reducing conflicts.

4. **Better Quality Software:**  
   Helps ensure that the final product meets user expectations and business requirements, resulting in higher satisfaction and fewer defects.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several key activities to ensure that the software system is well-defined and aligned with stakeholder expectations:

- **Requirement Gathering:**  
  Collecting information from stakeholders, users, and existing systems to understand their needs and expectations.

- **Requirement Elicitation:**  
  Engaging stakeholders through interviews, questionnaires, workshops, and observations to uncover both explicit and implicit requirements.

- **Requirement Documentation:**  
  Organizing and recording requirements in a structured format, such as SRS (Software Requirements Specification), for clarity and reference.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:**  
  Refining and organizing requirements, identifying dependencies, and creating visual models (like use case diagrams or flowcharts) to better understand the system.

- **Requirement Validation:**  
  Ensuring that the documented requirements are complete, feasible, consistent, and aligned with business objectives through reviews and stakeholder feedback.


5. **Facilitates Planning and Design:**  
   Detailed requirements guide architecture, design decisions, testing strategies, and project management throughout the SDLC.

## Types of Requirements

Requirements are classified into two main categories: Functional and Non-functional. Understanding both types is essential for building a complete and reliable system.

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define **what the system should do**—the specific behavior or functions the software must perform.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- Users can search for available properties based on location, date, and number of guests.
- Users can create, update, and cancel bookings.
- Admins can approve, reject, or modify booking requests.
- The system sends email confirmations for bookings and cancellations.
- Users can leave reviews for properties they have booked.

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements describe **how the system performs tasks**—constraints or qualities the system must satisfy.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- The system should respond to user actions within 2 seconds.
- Data must be securely stored and encrypted at rest and in transit.
- The system must support at least 500 concurrent users.
- The user interface should be responsive and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- System uptime should be at least 99.9%.
